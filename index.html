            My first LOB on the Epica and it set the standards high! Everything was well organized and efficient. The crew was extremely nice about everything! Shout out for the 240 bar tank fills every dive and for the impromptu trip to the pearl farm! The food was always delicious and ample, and the boat itself was very comfortable and never felt crowded. Traveling as a solo diver, everyone was extremely friendly and 10 days flew by! I canâ€™t wait to come back and do the southern route.
